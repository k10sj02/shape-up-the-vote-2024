I consider this benchmark conservative because it might undercount the number of barbershops per capita in urban areas due to the weighting of rural localities.\n\n## Case Study of Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia has a population of about 1.6 million people. The city's diverse population might lead to a higher demand for specialized hair services, potentially requiring more salons and barbershops. The local economy, average income levels, and urban density can influence the number of viable salons and barbershops.\n\nBased on the industry benchmark, I estimate the following thresholds if we assume that for every 1,500 or 2,000 people, there is 1 salon/barbershop:\n\n**Low Estimate**: 1 salon/barbershop per 2,000 people → 1,600,000 / 2,000 = 800 salons/barbershops.\\\n**High Estimate**: 1 salon/barbershop per 1,500 people → 1,600,000 / 1,500 = 1,067 salons/barbershops.\n\nAs noted, the density of barbershops may be affected by geographic location: \n\n**Urban Areas**: Higher density areas may support more salons per capita due to ease of access and higher foot traffic.\\\n**Affluent Areas**: Higher income neighborhoods might have more demand for premium services, increasing the number of salons and barbershops.\n\nAs a result, based on the conservative industry benchmark, there should be approximately 800 to 1,100 salons/barbershops in Metro Philadelphia.\n\nOn the other hand, the Philadelphia Urban Area (PUA) with 5.7M residents, will have between 2850 to 3800 salons/barbershops.\n\nNote: *The Philadelphia Urban Area is NOT the same as the Greater Philadelphia area, which has 6M+ residents and includes parts of New Jersey and Delaware.*\n\n**Takeaway**: Our dataset has around 2250 barbershops across the PUA. As a result, we don't have a representative sample of salons on a city or district level. \n\n# National Average Benchmark\n\nAccording to Salon Spa Connection, in the USA, there are 444,102 salons (ca. 2023) in a population of 343,477,335. Because of the previously mentioned limitations of the industry benchmark, I will use the national average benchmark (1:773) for understanding the overall market saturation. Since Philadephia is probably a very saturated (urban) city, it will probably align closer with the national average. Due to its large Black population, I would assume the ratio is lower than the national average benchmark. A lower ratio (i.e., more salons per person) could indicate market saturation, especially in urban areas where competition is higher. \n\nConversely, in less densely populated areas, the ratio might be higher (fewer salons per person). The large gap between these numbers could indicate areas where the market is very competitive (closer to the national average) versus those that are still developing (closer to the industry benchmark). On a subregional level, I will roughly expect ratios to be lower in more urban neighbourhoods and higher in less urban neighborhoods.\n\nTherefore, based on the national average benchmark, with a population of 1.6M, Metro Philadelphia should have around 2070 salons, while, the Philadelphia urban area with a population of 5.7M should have around 7369 salons. \n\n[Reference](https://salonspaconnection.com/beauty-hair-salon-industry-statistics-in-2023/)\n\n## Creating Service Density KPI to Measure Salon/Barbershop Coverage in Each Locality\n\nTo understand the district-level trends in salon density in Philadelphia, I am going to create a ratio KPI between 0 to 1 that measures the density of salons/barbershops in a given locality. \n\n**Create Service Density KPI: ratio_people_per_salon (normalized to a scale between 0 and 1)**\n\nAssumptions (these numbers are just illustrative and do not correspond with the actual data): \n\n- Population: 1,600,000 people\n- Number of Salons/Barbershops: 1,200\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Ratio of People per Salon/Barbershop\n- Calculate the people per salon/barbershop: 1,600,000 ÷ 1,200 = 1,333.33. This means there is 1 barbershop for every 1,333 people.\n\nStep 2: Compare the Actual Ratio to the Benchmark\n- Divide the consequent (second term in the ratio) in the national benchmark by the consequent in the actual ratio: 773 ÷ 1,333.33 = 0.58.\n\nStep 3: Cap the KPI at 1\n- Determine the final KPI: Since 0.58 is less than 1, the KPI is 0.58. The KPI of 0.58 indicates that the area has fewer salons/barbershops per capita than the national average benchmark ratio of 1:773. This suggests that we need to scrape for more salons/barbershops to meet the ideal ratio.\n- If the result is greater than 1, we cap the KPI at 1. This means that we have met or exceeded the benchmark ratio of 1 salon/barbershop per 773 people. This means coverage is adequate and we have scraped enough salons/barbershops in this district. In other words, we have an optimal number of salons/barbershops relative to the area's population.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import jinja2\n# raw_query = \"\"\"\n#     with deduped_leads as (\n#         select
