It is important to distinguish these urban areas from larger regions such as the Greater Area, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), or Combined Statistical Areas (CSA), as these broader classifications can include suburbs from neighboring states. Including such regions could skew our state-specific benchmarks. For example, the Greater Philadelphia area might encompass parts of New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware, none of which are swing states.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# US Industry Benchmark\n\nA common industry benchmark in the US is approximately 1 salon/barbershop per 1,500 to 2,000 people. I consider this benchmark too broad based on the granularity of the data (city and district-level) we're looking at. This is because it might undercount the number of barbershops per capita in urban areas due to the weighting of rural/suburban localities.\n\n## Case Study of Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia has a population of about 1.6 million people. The city's diverse population might lead to a higher demand for specialized hair services, potentially requiring more salons and barbershops. The local economy, average income levels, and urban density can influence the number of viable salons and barbershops.\n\nBased on the industry benchmark, I estimate the following thresholds if we assume that for every 1,500 or 2,000 people, there is 1 salon/barbershop:\n\n**Low Estimate**: 1 salon/barbershop per 2,000 people → 1,600,000 / 2,000 = 800 salons/barbershops.\\\n**High Estimate**: 1 salon/barbershop per 1,500 people → 1,600,000 / 1,500 = 1,067 salons/barbershops.\n\nAs noted, the density of barbershops may be affected by geographic location: \n\n**Urban Areas**: Higher density areas may support more salons per capita due to ease of access and higher foot traffic.\\\n**Affluent Areas**: Higher income neighborhoods might have more demand for premium services, increasing the number of salons and barbershops.\n\nAs a result, based on the conservative industry benchmark, there should be approximately 800 to 1,100 salons/barbershops in Metro Philadelphia.\n\nOn the other hand, the Philadelphia Urban Area (PUA) with 5.7M residents, will have between 2850 to 3800 salons/barbershops.\n\nNote: *The Philadelphia Urban Area is NOT the same as the Greater Philadelphia area, which has 6M+ residents and includes parts of New Jersey and Delaware.*\n\n**Takeaway**: Our dataset has around 2250 barbershops across the PUA. As a result, we don't have a representative sample of salons on a city or district level. \n\n# National Average Benchmark\n\nAccording to SalonSpaConnection.com, in the USA, there are 444,102 salons (ca. 2023) in a population of 343,477,335. Because of the previously mentioned limitations of the industry benchmark, I will use the national average benchmark (1:773) for understanding the overall market saturation. Since Philadephia is probably a very saturated (urban) city, it will probably align closer with the national average. Due to its large Black population, I would assume the ratio is lower than the national average benchmark. A lower ratio (i.e., more salons per person) could indicate market saturation, especially in urban areas where competition is higher. \n\nConversely, in less densely populated areas, the ratio might be higher (fewer salons per person). The large gap between these numbers could indicate areas where the market is very competitive (closer to the national average) versus those that are still developing (closer to the industry benchmark). On a district level, I will roughly expect ratios to be lower in more urban neighbourhoods and higher in less urban neighborhoods.\n\nTherefore, based on the national average benchmark, with a population of 1.6M, Metro Philadelphia should have around 2070 salons, while, the Philadelphia urban area with a population of 5.7M should have around 7369 salons. \n\n# Creating a State-specific Benchmark after Double Checking Assumptions based on Total Population of Pennsylvania\n\nAccording to Salon Spa Connection, there are 20,322 salons (ca. 2023) in the entire state of Pennsylvania. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the Total Number of Salons/Barbershops in Pennsylvania:\n\n- With a population of 12,961,683, this is a ratio of 1:638. This is lower than the national average density, 1:773.\n\nStep 2: Determine Population Share of PUA:\n\n- 5,700,000/12,800,000 = 0.445 (or 44.5%)\n\nStep 3: Estimate the Number of Salons/Barbershops in PUA Based on its Share of State Population\n\n- Number of Salons/Barbershops in Philly = 0.445*20,322 = 9043\n\nAfter double-checking my assumptions, we can see that based on the state average of 1:638, **Philadelphia has even more salon/barbershops than expected**. \n\nNow, we can be even more precise. **Thus, the state average benchmark for salons per person in Pennsylvania is 1:633**. This benchmark takes into account state-wide density trends that are obscured by the national average. \n\n**Takeaway**: Instead of using the static national benchmark of 1:773, we can use more accurate density benchmarks for each US state.\n\n[Reference: SalonSpaConnection.com Hair Salon Industry Statistics](https://salonspaconnection.com/beauty-hair-salon-industry-statistics-in-2023/)\n\n## Creating Service Density KPI to Measure Salon/Barbershop Coverage in Each Locality\n\nTo understand the district-level trends in salon density in Philadelphia, I am going to create a ratio KPI between 0 to 1 that measures the density of salons/barbershops in a given locality. \n\n**Create Service Density KPI: ratio_people_per_salon (normalized to a scale between 0 and 1)**\n\nAssumptions (these numbers are just illustrative and do not correspond with the actual data): \n\n- Population: 1,600,000 people\n- Number of Salons/Barbershops: 1,200\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Ratio of People per Salon/Barbershop\n- Calculate the people per salon/barbershop: 1,600,000 ÷ 1,200 = 1,333.33. This means there is 1 barbershop for every 1,333 people.\n\nStep 2: Compare the Actual Ratio to the Benchmark\n- Divide the consequent (second term in the ratio) in the national benchmark by the consequent in the actual ratio: 773 ÷ 1,333.33 = 0.58.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Normalized KPI\n- Determine the final KPI: Since 0.58 is less than 1, the KPI is 0.58. The KPI of 0.58 indicates that the area has fewer salons/barbershops per capita than the national average benchmark ratio of 1:773. This suggests that we need to scrape for more salons/barbershops to meet the ideal ratio.\n- If the result is greater than 1, this means that we have met or exceeded the benchmark ratio of 1 salon/barbershop per 773 people. This means coverage is adequate and we have scraped enough salons/barbershops in this district. In other words, we have an optimal number of salons/barbershops relative to the area's population.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import jinja2\n# raw_query = \"\"\"\n#     with
