# Shape Up The Vote: 2024 Election Turnout Project

## Project Description
Shape Up The Vote is a non-partisan campaign aiming to increase voter turnout by transforming barbershops and salons into voter engagement hubs within their communities. In 2024, we plan to launch this program in 13 states, engaging 5,500 participating shops. Our strategy is based on relational organizing principles, allowing barbers and stylists to foster conversations about voting during election cycles.

As a remote-only program, we employ text and phone banking to communicate with potential participating shops and support them throughout the program. This project involves gathering data on potential participants, cleaning and enriching this data, and then using it to identify the most suitable shops to contact.

**Target States for 2024:** AZ, GA, NV, MI, NC, PA, WI, OH, CO, FL, TX, VA, NH

## Project Goals
- **Data Collection:** Compile a comprehensive list of shops across 13 states using Pline.io to scrape Google data.
- **Data Cleaning and Enrichment:** Utilize Hex, a data notebook tool, to clean and enrich the data with additional contextual information.
- **Analysis and Ranking:** Analyze and rank shops based on data quality, contact information, and their potential to serve as voter registration hubs.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Collection
**Objective:** Gather initial data sets of barbershops across the designated states.
**Tools:** Pline.io Chrome extension for scraping relevant data from Google.
**Output:** Data stored directly in Google Drive for accessibility and collaborative work.

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Enrichment
**Objective:** Clean the scraped data for accuracy and completeness, enrich with additional relevant information.
**Tools:** Hex for data manipulation, cleaning, and integration of additional data points such as textable phone numbers and community demographics.
**Output:** A cleaned and enriched dataset ready for analysis.

### Phase 3: Data Analysis and Compilation
**Objective:** Analyze the cleaned data to identify and rank the most suitable barbershops for the initiative.
**Criteria for Ranking:**
- **Quality:** Presence and completeness of contact information, and textable status of phone numbers.
- **Fit:** Location in underserved areas, communities of color, and regions with historically low voter registration rates.
